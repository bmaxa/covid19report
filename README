Covid reports sorted from John Hopkins,
all commands have --help
./target/release/import_data -u githubuser -p githubpass
or just unzip foo.zip as I import daily...
./target/release/reports for default report
or --help for parameters.

* added --date since 
to import 
From now on I will import just last month as this is getting big
and github no longer accepts basic authentication.

build like any usual Rust program: cargo build --release
